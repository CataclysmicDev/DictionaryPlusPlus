# CataclysmicDev - Dictionary++

Dictionary++ is a lua module which builds upon the normal dictionaries!

#
Why use Dictionary++ and what are the advantages to using it?
>*"It's easier!"* - It adds so much more to the original way dictionaries work!
>
>"*It's faster for development!*"  You can check the length of a dictionary without those annoying for i, v in pairs() do loops!
>
>"*Getting data is easier!*" - You can easily add/remove to it
>
>"*Again...getting data is easier!*" - You can use a function known as "descend" which is similiar to GetDescendants!
>
>plus a lot more!

I hope to one day see a future where Dictionary++ is the norm to use in games as the current way dictionaries are handled are very outdated!
